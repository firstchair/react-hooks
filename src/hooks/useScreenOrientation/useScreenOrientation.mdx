# useScreenOrientation

`useScreenOrientation` is a custom React hook for handling screen orientation changes. It listens
for window resizing events, determining the screen's current orientation (portrait or landscape).
This hook is useful for building UIs that adapt based on device orientation, enhancing user
experience across various devices.

## Reference

```ts
function useScreenOrientation(): { isLandscape: boolean; isPortait: boolean };
```

### Returns

- An object with 2 values: isLandscape and isPortrait, both booleans where the later is the opposite
  of the first.

## Usage

```tsx
function DemoComponent() {
  const { isLandscape } = useScreenOrientation();
  return <div>Orientation: {isLandscape ? 'Landscape' : 'Portrait'}</div>;
}
```
