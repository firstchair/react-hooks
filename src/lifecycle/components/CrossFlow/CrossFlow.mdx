# CrossFlow

`<CrossFlow />` is a component that allows you to defer the unmount lifecycle of a component.

The callback function used in `useBeforeUnmount` in components that are rendered in the context of
`<CrossFlow />` will be called just before a component is unmounted. The promises that are created
using the callback are awaited before unmounting a component. In the CrossFlow component new
children are immediately rendered.

The most common use-case for `<CrossFlow />` is animations, but it's not limited to this use case.

## Props

### Children

`<CrossFlow />` accepts a single child, use a `Fragment` when you want to render multiple components
on the root level. New children are rendered when the component type for the children (`<p />` to
`<div />`) change, or when the key of the children changes (`<p key="one" />` to `null`).

```tsx
// Transition between two instances
<CrossFlow>
  {myBoolean ? <MyComponent key="first-instance" /> : <MyComponent key="second-instance" />}
</CrossFlow>

// Transition between component types (new instances are automatically created)
<CrossFlow>
  {myBoolean ? <FirstComponent /> : <SecondComponent />}
</CrossFlow>
```

### onChildrenMounted

The `onChildrenMounted` is called when the new children are mounted.

```tsx
onChildrenMounted?: () => void;

<CrossFlow onChildrenMounted={() => console.log('onChildrenMounted')}>
  ...
</CrossFlow>
```
