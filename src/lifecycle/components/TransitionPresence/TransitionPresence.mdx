# TransitionPresence

`<TransitionPresence />` is a component that allows you to defer the unmount lifecycle of a
component.

The callback function used in `useBeforeUnmount` in components that are rendered in the context of
`<TransitionPresence />` will be called just before a component is unmounted. The promises that are
created using the callback are awaited before unmounting a component. New children are rendered
after old children are unmounted.

The most common use-case for `<TransitionPresence />` is animations, but it's not limited to this
use case.

## Props

### Children

`<TransitionPresence />` accepts a single child, use a `Fragment` when you want to render multiple
components on the root level. New children are rendered when the component type for the children
(`<p />` to `<div />`) change, or when the key of the children changes (`<p key="one" />` to
`null`).

### onPreviousChildrenUnmounting

The `onPreviousChildrenUnmounting` is called before the unmounting starts.

```tsx
onPreviousChildrenUnmounting?: () => void;

<TransitionPresence onPreviousChildrenUnmounting={() => console.log('onPreviousChildrenUnmounting')}>
```

### onPreviousChildrenUnmounted

The `onPreviousChildrenUnmounted` is called when the unmounting of previous children is done, the
next children are not rendered yet at this point.

```tsx
onPreviousChildrenUnmounted?: () => void;

<TransitionPresence onPreviousChildrenUnmounted={() => console.log('onPreviousChildrenUnmounted')}>
```

### onChildrenMounted

The `onChildrenMounted` is called when the new children are mounted.

```tsx
onChildrenMounted?: () => void;

<TransitionPresence onChildrenMounted={() => console.log('onChildrenMounted')}>
```
