# useBeforeUnmount

The `useBeforeUnmount` hook accepts a function that will be called before the component is
unmounted. The callback function is awaited, it defers the unmounting of the component until the
function is resolved when it is wrapped in a `TransitionPresence` or `CrossFlow` context.

```tsx
function useBeforeUnmount(
  callback: (abortSignal: AbortSignal) => PromiseLike<unknown> | void,
): void;
```

## Waiting for an animation before unmounting

A common use case for the `useBeforeUnmount` hook is to create an out transition that defers the
unmounting of the component until the transition is complete.

<Canvas of={transitionPrescenseStories.Demo} />

The out transition in the demo is created using the Animation API.

```tsx
useBeforeUnmount(async () => {
  if (!ref.current) {
    return;
  }

  const animation = ref.current.animate([{ opacity: 1 }, { opacity: 0 }], {
    duration: 500,
    fill: 'forwards',
  });

  return animation.finished;
});
```

## How to deal with forced unmounting

A component instance can be prematurely unmounted in two situations. First, when the
`TransitionPresence` context is unmounted. Second, when a new direct child is rendered in
`TransitionPresence` before the callback of the previous child has resolved. To handle this
situation, you can use the `AbortSignal` to cancel any running actions.

### Cancelling an animation

```tsx
useBeforeUnmount(async (abortSignal) => {
  if (!ref.current) {
    return;
  }

  const animation = ref.current.animate([{ opacity: 1 }, { opacity: 0 }], {
    duration: 500,
    fill: 'forwards',
  });

  abortSignal.addEventListener('abort', () => {
    animation.cancel();
  });

  await animation.finished;
});
```

### Cancelling a request

```tsx
useBeforeUnmount(async (abortSignal) => {
  await fetch('https://example.com/', {
    signal: abortSignal,
  });
});
```
