# useScrollAnimation

The `useScrollAnimation` hook is used to created an animation with GSAP that uses ScrollTrigger. The
animation is killed when the component unmounts, the animation is updated when one of the
dependencies change. ScrollTrigger is refreshed when an animation instance created with
`useScrollTrigger` is updated.

## Usage

The function signature for `useScrollAnimation` is exactly the same as `useAnimation`.

An animation is created in the callback function of the useAnimation hook. The callback hook should
return an animation instance. The `useScrollAnimation` hook returns a RefObject with the animation
instance, the animation instance is availble on mount.

The callback accepts a `gsap.core.Animation` instance as a return type. You can use tweens
(`gsap.to`, `gsap.from`, `gsap.fromTo`) and `gsap.timelines` to create an animation.

```tsx
function ScrollAnimation(): ReactElement {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);

  useScrollAnimation(
    () =>
      gsap.to(ref.current, {
        scale: 0.5,
        ease: 'power3.out',
        scrollTrigger: {
          pin: ref.current,
          scrub: true,
          markers: true,
          end: '+=150%',
        },
      }),
    [],
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <div
        ref={ref}
        style={{
          width: '100%',
          height: '100vh',
          margin: '0 auto',
          background: 'purple',
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

> Note: do not scrub a React component's root. GSAP modifies the DOM, React won't know what element
> to unmount when the component with a pinned animation must removed from the vDOM.

## Example

Keep scrolling to see the animation.

<Canvas of={stories.UseScrollAnimation} />
